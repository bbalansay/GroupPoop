# GroupPoop

## Project Description

The target audience for GroupPoop are primarily the **students and faculty** at the **University of Washington**, though in the future we hope this to be scaled to a wider audience. 

We envision this population to use our application to find the best pit stops on campus. This application could be applied to anyone visiting the University of Washington, but we will be focusing on students and faculty because they are the predominant population on campus.

Our audience seeks to use GroupPoop to achieve the satisfying, entertaining break that they deserve. Bathrooms and their locations on campus will be stored in our database and each will have a rating based on ambience, cleanliness, toilet paper quality, etc. Users will also be able to join chats with others in the process of going about their business. With GroupPoop, users will truly feel like royalty on the porcelain throne.

Most of us, if not all of us, have had some uncomfortable situations when needing to use the restroom on campus. There is an inequality that exists between buildings and their bathrooms, and we want people to have the most comfortable experience when they need to relieve themselves. GroupPoop can make that happen.
